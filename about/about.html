          <article>
            I was born in 1979 and raised in a small, New Jersey town. My early life there has affected much of my life since then. Mostly in good ways.
              <br><br>
            I graduated from the Ringling College of Art in Sarasota, Florida in 2003. After that I found a new home in Tampa and started to work in the screen printing industry. That industry became by driving force for most of my career with its highs and lows. Now I find myself in Austin, Texas and in search of a new career.
              <br><br>
            Now I begin a new journey into the world of Web Development. Let's see where this takes me next.
